#  MSBA6331-Simplifying Recommender Systems: Amazon Personalize x Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler
This work is completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

# Project Overview
 The project aims at unlocking the synergy of Amazon Personalize and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler. Amazon Personalize has been the go-to recommendation tool as it integrates multiple algorithms into a single platform. It is especially valuable to small businesses that may not have the resources to develop their proprietary recommendation systems. On the other hand, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler makes data pre-processing extremely simpler as it contains over 300 built-in data transformations, so one can quickly transform data without writing any code and complete each step of the data preparation workflow (including data selection, cleansing, exploration, visualization, and processing at scale) from a single visual interface. We intend to use both these tools to showcase the potential of Amazon Personalize in a very user-friendly way without the need for writing tonnes of code. We will also evaluate the efficacy of different recommender systems in comparison to Amazon Personalize.
