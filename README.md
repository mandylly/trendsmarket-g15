#  MSBA6331-Simplifying Recommender Systems: Amazon Personalize x Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler
This work is completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

# Project Overview
The project aims at unlocking the synergy of Amazon Personalize and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler. Amazon Personalize has been the go-to recommendation tool as it integrates multiple algorithms into a single platform. It is especially valuable to small businesses that may not have the resources to develop their proprietary recommendation systems. On the other hand, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler makes data pre-processing extremely simpler as it contains over 300 built-in data transformations, so one can quickly transform data without writing any code and complete each step of the data preparation workflow (including data selection, cleansing, exploration, visualization, and processing at scale) from a single visual interface. We intend to use both these tools to showcase the potential of Amazon Personalize in a very user-friendly way without the need for writing tonnes of code. We will also evaluate the efficacy of different recommender systems in comparison to Amazon Personalize.

# Business Problem
Recommender systems are crucial in establishing a strong relationship with a consumer to the subscription service or e-commerce platform that they opt for. We see strong recommender systems being in action when we shop online (Walmart), watch movies (Netflix, Hulu), music streaming platforms (Spotify) etc. While these corporate giants can afford to have a data science team that will help them with the data pre-processing and feature engineering steps before the recommender system steps in, small business owners still struggle to use the same. This is where Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler and Personalize can empower small businesses with limited capacity and resources to develop recommender systems for their businesses without needing the skills of a seasoned data scientist.
